## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their list by entering a description and clicking "Add."

- **Mark as Complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the checkbox next to each task.

- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks they no longer wish to keep on their list by clicking the "Delete" button.

## Storing Tasks in LocalStorage

The tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing users to keep their to-do list even after closing the browser. This ensures that your tasks persist between sessions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application.

3. To add a new task, enter the description in the text field and click "Add."

4. To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox next to the task.

5. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

## Customization

If you want to customize the appearance of the to-do list, you can modify the CSS file (`styles.css`) to adjust the styles to your preferences.
